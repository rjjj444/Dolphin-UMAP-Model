#2. Nearest neighbor evaluation of embedding

#Evaluate the embedding based on calltype labels of nearest neighbors.

#2.1. Remove unlabelled datapoints
#Any unlabelled calls can be ignored for these evaluations, so remove these from the dataset

labelled_df = df.loc[df[LABEL_COL]!=NA_INDICATOR,:] # create dataframe with only the labelled datapoints

UMAP_COLS = [x for x in labelled_df.columns if 'UMAP' in x]   # detects UMAP columns
print("Found", len(UMAP_COLS), "UMAP columns in df, using all ",len(UMAP_COLS)," for subsequent analyses.")


labels = labelled_df[LABEL_COL]                # manual labels
embedding = np.asarray(labelled_df[UMAP_COLS]) # UMAP coordinates

#ex. output: Found 3 UMAP columns in df, using all  3  for subsequent analyses.

#2.2. Calculate nearest neighbor statistics
#To evaluate how well call types are grouped in latent space, we assess the class (e.g. manual call type label) of the knn=5 nearest neighbors of each datapoint in the latent space.


knn=5 #  for knn=5 nearest neighbors

nn_stats = nn(embedding, np.asarray(labels), k=knn)

# Summary scores
print("Evaluation score S (unweighted average of same-class probability P for all classes):",round(nn_stats.get_S(),3))
print("Evaluation score Snorm (unweighted average of normalized same-class probability Pnorm for all classes)::",round(nn_stats.get_Snorm(),3))

#Ex. output: Evaluation score S (unweighted average of same-class probability P for all classes): 61.804
            # Evaluation score Snorm (unweighted average of normalized same-class probability Pnorm for all classes):: 2.354

#2.3. Plot nearest neighbor metrics

#2.3.1. Absolute score
#In this evaluation matrix, each field M[i,j] is the probability P (in percentage) for datapoints of label i to have a neighbor with label j in the latent space (based on the observed frequencies of certain labels among the knn nearest neighbors). For ease of interpretation, we add a row for the overall probability of encountering a neighbor with label j in the dataset (= the frequency of j in the dataset).
#Same-class probability is on the diagnoal.

nn_stats.plot_heat_S(vmin=0,       # lower end (for color scheme)
                     vmax=100,     # upper end (for color scheme)
                     center=50,    # center(for color scheme)
                     cmap=sns.color_palette("Greens", as_cmap=True),# color scheme 
                     cbar=None,    # show colorbar if True else don't
                     outname=None) # filename (with path) where figure will be saved. Default: None -> figure not saved

#Reference Github for ex. output

#2.3.2. Normalized score
#Since these absolute neighborhood frequencies are not normalized to class imbalances (e.g. a heavily overrepresented class is more likely to have higher neighborhood frequencies by chance alone), we normalized this probability of encountering same-class datapoints among the k=5 nearest neighbors to the overall probability of encountering same-class datapoints to account for the varying call type frequencies in the dataset. This score can be interpreted as the fold increase in likelihood of same-class neighbors over the random chance expectation:
#(-> 2 means that observed frequency is twice as much as expected by random chance, 0.5 means that neighborhood label was observed half as often as expected by random chance)

nn_stats.plot_heat_fold(center=1,    # center(for color scheme)
                        cmap=sns.diverging_palette(20, 145, as_cmap=True),# color scheme 
                        cbar=None,    # show colorbar if True else don't
                        outname=None) # filename (with path) where figure will be saved. Default: None -> figure not saved

#2.3.3. Normalized, log-transformed score
#We then applied a log2 transformation, such that the score is symmetric around zero and can be interpreted as the fold in- or decrease (positive or negative values, respectively) in likelihood over the random chance expectation:
#(--> e.g. 2 is twice as much as random chance expectation, -2 is half as much as random chance expection)

nn_stats.plot_heat_Snorm(vmin=-13,     # lower end (for color scheme)
                         vmax=13,      # upper end (for color scheme)
                         center=1,     # center(for color scheme)
                         cmap=sns.diverging_palette(20, 145, as_cmap=True),# color scheme 
                         cbar=None,    # show colorbar if True else don't

#3. Evaluation based on pairwise distances
#Since nearest neighbor metrics only capture one aspect of class separation in space, we recommend evaluating other aspects of class separation, such as the overall distances within a call type group (“between”) vs. towards calls of a different type (“outside”). Hence, we calculated all pairwise distances within datapoints of the same calltype x, ("within") vs. all pairwise distances of datapoints of calltype x towards datapoints of all other calltypes ("between") and plot their distribution.

                    distance_metric='euclidean', # distance metric (all scipy distance metrics are valid)
                    outname=None,                # filename (with path) where figure will be saved. Default: None -> figure not saved
                    xmin=0,xmax=12,              # xaxis minimum and maximum
                    ymax=0.5,                    # yaxis maximum
                    nbins=50,                    # number of bins
                    nrows=4,                     # number of rows of subplots
                    ncols=2,                     # number of cols of subplots
                    density=True)                # plot density if True else plot frequency

#--> The more separated the two distributions, the closer the datapoints of the calltype are clustered together and at the same time are far away from other clusters/datapoints

###############################
#4. Silhouette Plot

#As a means to quantify the global clustering by call type, we calculated the Silhouette values of the manual label clusters in UMAP space and plotted the scores for all datapoints, sorted by call type group. Silhouette value indicates how close datapoints are to their own cluster compared to other clusters and is defined as:
# sil(x) = (b-a)max(a,b)
#with a being the mean intra-cluster distance in the cluster of datapoint x and b the mean distance between x and the nearest neighboring cluster. Positive scores thus indicate that this datapoint is nearby elements of the same cluster, whereas negative scores indicate that this datapoint is actually closer to elements of another cluster.

sil_stats = sil(embedding, labels)
sil_stats.plot_sil(outname=None) # filename (with path) where figure will be saved. Default: None -> figure not saved

#You should get a color coded silhouette plot (silhoueutte value x cluster label)

#EXTRA: Example Application: Graph from embedding evaluation

#To visualize the degree to which different call types are found in close vicinity of each other, we constructed a neighborhood graph where nodes represent call types and edges represent the frequency of the call types’ neighborhood in latent space. In more detail, we transform the evaluation matrix of the normalized k nearest neighbor probabilities (Pnorm) of the UMAP embedding into a symmetric distance matrix, replace each field with the average of itself and its diagonal counterpart (M[i,j] = mean(M[i,j], M[j,i] and then M[j,i] = M[i,j]), multiply the matrix by -1 and set the diagonal to zero. We then generate an approximation of a graph where edge length represents the distance values from the matrix using network and pygraphviz.

G = nn_stats.draw_simgraph(outname = None) # filename (with path) where figure will be saved. Default: None -> figure not saved

# show graph inline:
Image(G.draw(format='png',prog='neato'), width=400, height=600)

#Ex. output can be found in Github
